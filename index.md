<h1>About the workshop</h1>

Starting out from Craig's interpolation theorem for first-order logic, the
existence and computation of interpolant formulas became an
active research area, with applications in different fields, notably in verification,
databases and knowledge representation. There are challenging theoretical and
practical questions, for model theoretic as well as proof theoretic
approaches. The workshop aims at bringing together researchers working on
interpolation and its various applications, based on different approaches,
increasing the awareness of the automated reasoning community for challenging
open problems related to interpolation.

iPRA 2022, the 4th workshop on interpolation is affiliated with IJCAR 2022. The workshop continues the iPRA workshop series:
